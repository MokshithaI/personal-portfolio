            <h1> Mokshitha Iragamreddy </h1>
            <p> About me: I'm a Computer Science B.S. student at Iowa State University with a minor in Applied Artificial Intelligence 
                and a 3.91 GPA, and I enjoy building practical software that saves people time. Recently, I built an AI-powered job 
                application matcher that scores roles against my skills, generates tailored resume bullets and cover-letter drafts, 
                tracks everything in a Google Sheet, and sends email summaries. I also created a Python CLI expense tracker focused on 
                clean object-oriented design, persistence, and easy filtering. On campus, I work as an IT Support Specialist helping deploy
                and manage 800+ devices, and as a CS Help Room Tutor where I guide students through Python/Java debugging and core OOP concepts.

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p> The first project focuses on designing a Web page using
            HTML and CSS. In terms of the layout, a navigation bar is
            created at the top displaying a list of menu items. We
            include some text describing each section of the page.
            Additionally, we included two images to enhance the visual
            appeal of the page.</p>
